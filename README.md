# GeoMovementCorpora
The GeoMovement Corpora consists of the gold corpus and the silver corpus.

The **gold** corpus contains the type of thing moving and 5 votes by human participants as to whether it describes movement or not.

The **silver** corpus was hand checked by the author for whether it describes movement or not.

If you use either corpus in your research, please cite the corpora themselves.
