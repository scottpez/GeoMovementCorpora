725,"Migrations generally follow a north-south pathway, although a few bird species – namely oceanic birds -- may migrate in a circular pattern.",0,https://www.perkypet.com/advice/bird-watching/bird-migration-facts/timing
726,"With so many bird species migrating to and from North America, it’s impossible to pin down exact dates for fall bird migration.",0,https://www.perkypet.com/advice/bird-watching/bird-migration-facts/timing
727,"Likewise, most bird species have huge summer ranges, so saying that all White-throated Sparrows begin migration around September 10 would be misleading.",0,https://www.perkypet.com/advice/bird-watching/bird-migration-facts/timing

1141,"In contrast with models that assume coastal hunter-gatherer-fishers typically lived in small, simple societies, we propose that trading for and utilizing copper is evidence of emergent hierarchical social organization during the Archaic and the likelihood that power was gained and displayed during large-scale gatherings and ceremonial events.",0,http://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/E7672

1146,"The exotic copper and cremated remains are unique in coastal South Carolina and Georgia where Archaic-age cremations are conspicuously absent and no other Archaic copper objects have been reported.

1719,"We estimated the likelihood that a cell within the δ2Hf isoscape represented a potential origin for a sample by using a normal probability density function to estimate the likelihood function based upon the observed δ2Hf [37], [59]. Next, we assessed the posterior likelihood by applying a von Mises probability density function fit to the aforementioned band recovery data, and incorporated these as spatially explicit prior probabilities using Baye's Theorem to assess the joint likelihoods [37].

2041,Adult songbirds have a lot of different strategies.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2042,"The thrushes and many warblers also eat a lot of ‘bugs’ during the breeding season, when summer productivity is high and there are lots of juicy lepidopteran larvae around.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2043,"In fall though, many switch to gorging on fruits.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2044,"Many songbirds are key seed-dispersers actually, and the many red-berried fruits decorating fall forests are a testament to the co-evolution of birds and plants (see the Wood Thrush-American Ginseng example here).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2045,"During the overwintering period, many songbirds continue to eat fruit, and some even take on a nectarivorous diet, like the Cape May Warbler Setophaga tigrina (Latta and Faaborg 2002).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2046,"When birds do eat a mixed diet of animal and plant-based foods, is there an optimal combination for staying healthy?",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2062,I analyzed the diet of Wood Thrushes from my study site in Belize.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2063,"It can be challenging to figure out the diet of small songbirds, since they are not easy to watch in the wild.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2064,"I don’t know how many times I saw a Wood Thrush foraging on a trail, then ran over as soon as it flushed to try to see what it had been eating.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2065,Usually there was no sign of anything!,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2066,These isotopes are useful for distinguishing a diet of plant- vs. animal foods because the animals should always have higher stable nitrogen isotope ratios (and to a lesser extent carbon ratios) than the plants.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2067,"It was more obvious when they were eating fruit, since they would join up with dozens of other Wood Thrushes and many other species, like the tropical resident Clay-coloured Robins, Black-faced Tanagers, Gray Catbirds, and even toucans like the Collared Araçari, all in the tops of fruiting trees, generally making an obvious ruckus and spitting out seeds all over the ground under the trees.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2068,I saw this most frequently with Ramon or breadnut trees,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2074,Maybe the bigger birds like toucans are what this tree is really hoping for?  ,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2075,"To analyze the diet of Wood Thrushes, I decided to look at the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen and carbon in their blood.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2076,"Basically, there are multiple isotopes of these common elements, and animals preferentially incorporate the lighter isotope into their tissues.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2077,This means that animals eating things higher up on the food chain will be consuming tissues with more of the heavier isotope.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2078,"For example, a top predator, like a jaguar, would have a higher stable isotope ratio of Nitrogen compared to a herbivore like a tapir.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2079,"Carbon works basically the same way, but also with some differences in the isotope ratio of different types of plants (e.g. grasses versus herbaceous).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2080,I analyzed the data to see if the highest stable isotope values were associated with the best body condition in Wood Thrushes.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2081,That means a Wood Thrush eating more bugs will also have a higher stable nitrogen isotope ratio in its tissues.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2082,"For this project, I was already collecting a tiny blood sample for genetic sexing ",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2085,"I also collected a bunch of potential food sources for comparison – beetles, ants, fruits, spiders, and grasshoppers.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2086,"First I just looked at the isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, then I tried to reconstruct the actual proportions of different foods in the diet by using a mixing model.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2087,"Here’s the basic food web that I reconstructed: On the vertical axis is the ratio of stable nitrogen isotopes, which we call delta-15-N, measured in units of permil (that weird percent thing in the brackets).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2088,"As you go up the food chain, delta-15-N gets higher, which is why spiders and Wood Thrushes are in the top part of the graph, and fruits and grasshoppers at the bottom.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2089,"The horizontal axis shows the stable carbon isotopes, or delta-13-C.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2090,"The dots are the average values, and the crosses show the variation around the average.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2091,"You can see that Wood Thrushes are all the same (no visible error bars) but beetles and spiders are really variable, especially in delta 15-N.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2092,This is probably because I lumped a lot of different species of these guys together.  ,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2093,"Right away, the data seemed to suggest that Wood Thrushes were not eating that much fruit.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2094,Their stable nitrogen ratios were just too high!,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2095,I suspect they have important stories to tell.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2096,Did birds at the ‘top’ end of the food web have a payoff compared with birds slightly lower down?,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2097,"no, although, there wasn’t a lot of variability in the diets of the Wood Thrushes I analyzed.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2098,"Most of them seemed to be eating primarily arthropods, and the slight variability across individuals didn’t predict their body condition, fat or muscle levels.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2099,But there were some interesting patterns in the data that were somewhat unexpected.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2100,"First, I did find some differences by habitat.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2101,"Birds in the driest, early successional forest tended to eat more fruit mid-winter but then actually increased the amount of arthropods they consumed as spring approached.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2102,"The opposite pattern was found in the more mature forest sites, with the end result that diets were actually very similar across all habitats in late winter.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2103,"This tells me that Wood Thrushes in different habitats might be fine eating whatever is easiest and available all winter, but as spring approaches they seek out an optimal balance of fruit and arthropods.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2104,"This habitat difference also likely explains a few differences I found between males and females, since females were more abundant in the dry habitat.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2105,"The diet differences didn’t relate to body condition though, so it wasn’t that females or birds in the dry habitat were suffering because of their different diets.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2106,So seems like bugs with a side of fruit is what Wood Thrushes go for in the winter (and not fruit with a side of bugs).,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2107,What exact types of bugs and fruits would be interesting to figure out –,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2133,The data for boreal songbirds are a little less strong because the breeding bird surveys used to generate population trends tend to peter out as you go further away from human population centres.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2134,"However, many boreal songbirds are very long-distance migrants (i.e. they go all the way from the temperate boreal to South America), which is a big risk factor, and the trends that we do have don’t look very promising for most, including the Connecticut Warbler.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2164,Does what happens in the Tropics stay in the Tropics?   ,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2165,Does what happens in the Tropics stay in the Tropics?,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2166,Temperate-dwelling people who ‘migrate’ to the Tropics often show ‘carry-over effects’ of their overwintering period upon their return.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2167,"Those who spent a week or two at an all-inclusive resort might come home relaxed, tanned, perhaps fatter or fitter, depending on the individual preference.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2168,"I often returned from my tropical sojourns bug-bitten, tired, but elated at the experience.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2169,"How does their Tropical stay affect them, once they leave?",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2172,We migrate home from Belize on a plane (sometimes I even get to co-pilot the puddle-jumpers to Belize City!),0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2173,So what happens on spring migration?,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2174,"Does it matter if they are in poor condition, or in poor-quality habitat in winter?",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2175,"Or do their migration genes just get them on their way, regardless of what condition they are in?",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2176,"Come back next year, Wood Thrush (with your backpack still on, please)!",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2177,"I had migration data from Wood Thrushes tagged at a breeding site in Pennsylvania, USA –",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2178,I tried to answer these questions by combining our geolocator-tracking data (from Belize and also from across the breeding and wintering range) with body condition data and remote sensing of habitat dryness.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2179,"For the latter, there is a nifty satellite-derived index of habitat quality called NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index – see figure below).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2180,"It basically is a picture of the world from space, and the greenness of each pixel in the picture has a value.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2181,"The more green, the higher the NDVI value, the more productive (as in plant productivitiy), wet, and full of bugs a particular forest is; conversely, less green = less productive, drier, and correspondingly fewer bugs.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2182,"We know that Wood Thrush body condition is correlated with habitat dryness and bugginess, so this makes the NDVI a good remote indicator of habitat quality.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2183,"This is what the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index looks like for the world in March – lots of snow in the North, but green in the Tropics and in the temperate south.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2184,We also have our detailed migration data from geolocators.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2185,Just a reminder: these are archival tags (they don’t transmit data) that give us estimates of latitudes and longitudes for each day based on light levels (sunrise/set times and day length).,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2186,"We can also figure out migration distance, speed (overall distance/duration in days), and the number of days spent at stopover sites.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2187,We expected that birds in poor body condition (smaller than expected based on their size) would show negative carry-over effects on migration.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2188,"For example, a skinny bird might have to delay its departure, or travel more slowly, stopping more frequently along the way, resulting in a later arrival at breeding sites.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2189,The breeding arrival date is really critical because this predicts reproductive success in many species.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2190,Late arrivers either get crappy territories (males) or crappy mates (females) and which results in fewer babies for those birds in the long run.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2191,Of course really poor condition probably results in not surviving spring migration at all!,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2192,But we can’t measure this because we only have information from birds that survived to bring us back their migration-tracking geolocator.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2193,"Definitely a bias, but an unavoidable one at the moment.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2194,So we compared body condition of my Belize birds to their spring migration performance.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2195,"Surprisingly, we found that birds in poor condition didn’t do anything significantly different from those in the best condition!",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2196,"Their timing, stopover behaviour, and speeds were not significantly related to their condition.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2197,"If you squint hard at the data, it’s almost the opposite effect – birds in good condition hung on later than those in the worst condition!",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2198,Wood Thrushes in good shape (body condition positive) were not earlier to leave than birds in poor shape (negative condition index).,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2199,"There was also no difference in timing later during migration, in speed, duration, or distance travelled.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2200,"Given that this was a pretty small sample size (under 30 birds) all from the same location (Belize), I thought I would expand my tests using some of our other lab tracking data.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2201,This is where the NDVI comes in.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2202,"we knew where these guys were in the winter, and using NDVI we could remotely measure the quality of the habitat.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2203,I compared  winter habitat quality to spring migration performance to see if birds wintering in drier sites had poor performance compared to birds in wetter sites.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2204,I found some support for the idea that winter habitat carries-over to affect spring migration.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2205,"Birds in drier sites departed significantly later than birds in wetter sites; however, the dry-site birds caught up!",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2206,"If these dry-winter-site birds are catching up, they must be moving faster, and sure enough, I found that lower NDVI was associated with faster speeds and shorter spring migration duration.",1,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2207,"Overall this shows that birds in very dry winter sites may take longer to depart, but they seem to be able to compensate for this en route and arrive at their breeding site without delay.",1,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2208,"The last part of my study involved comparing migration performance of birds from my Belize study site, and a site in Costa Rica",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2209,"(La Selva, where co-author Calandra Stanley did the ground-work; she’s now doing a PhD at the Smithsonian/University of Maryland).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2210,These two sites are interesting because they are really different in terms of habitat moisture,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2211,"– Belize is always drier, and it dries out faster than Costa Rica.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2212,How do these broad-scale differences in habitat quality relate to migration?,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2213,They also depart later and have later timing along their entire migration.,1,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2214,This might be because they have significantly longer wings.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2215,Overall this goes a long way to explain the species-wide leap-frog migration pattern in Wood Thrushes.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2216,"The relationship I show with migration and habitat quality could be what’s maintaining this overall, species-level pattern.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2217,"Birds in Costa Rica can afford to stay longer because the forest is still relatively productive, and their farther breeding sites would still be under snow cover anyway.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2218,"In contrast, the Belize birds face an increasingly hostile (i.e. dry) winter site.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2219,"They don’t need to worry about fuelling up as much as the Costa Rica birds either, because they are covering a lot less ground.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2220,"Wood Thrushes in Costa Rica are in wetter habitat, and they migrate on average 1000km further than Wood Thrush from drier habitat in Belize.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2221,"In the late 1980s, a tiny non-profit group in Wilmington, Delaware—",0,https://www.thoughtco.com/amelia-earharts-fate-archaeological-investigations-172043
2222,"So overall, what happens in the Tropics doesn’t seem to have much of an effect on individual Wood Thrushes (and where it does, they seem to be able to compensate by speeding up their migration).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2223,"But the overall patterns of habitat quality (drier in the north, wetter in the south) are correlated with broad-scale differences in migration behaviour (earlier timing, shorter distances in the north; later timing, longer distances in the south) leading to the leap-frog system that we see at the species-level.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2241,Songbirds are really like little programmed robots,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2242,– their genes are so finely tuned that they can accomplish these amazing feats of migration without ever thinking about it.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2243,"For first-time migrants, this is even more amazing, since they have no opportunity to learn their routes from their parents, or other adults.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2244,"In fact, since most songbirds migrate at night, they probably can’t even see the other birds they might be flying with.",1,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2261,"However, the exact route that they need to take is not the same as in fall (many birds do a loop migration, where spring and fall migration occur along different routes, probably because of favourable wind patterns).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2262,This means juvenile birds have to figure out a new route to get to their inaugural breeding site.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2263,"Songbirds tend to be site faithful to the same territories after they have bred there once, but juveniles rarely return to the exact territory where they were hatched (that could lead to inbreeding).",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2264,"Instead, juveniles are thought to aim for the general area where they were hatched (leading to the patterns of migratory connectivity we discovered), so that a young bird from Vermont might return somewhere nearby – a few hundred kilometres away.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2266,"So even in spring, when juveniles have a little experience, it’s still pretty amazing that they can find their way back to a breeding site at all.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2267,I studied the spring migrations of juvenile Wood Thrushes from my study site in Belize (www.bfreebz.org) and also used some data collected by my colleague Callie Stanley during her Masters work in Costa Rica (at La Selva Biological Station).,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2268,"One of the many advantages of studying birds in Belize is that I could catch juvenile birds before they left on migration, and if they survived to return the following year, I could map their very first journey north.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2269,To do this I used little bird backpacks called geolocators to track their migrations.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2270,See my previous blog post for an explanation of how they work.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2271,"Basically, they record where the bird is each day",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2272,"It’s challenging enough to catch those ‘golden’ backpack-wearing birds, but the odds of getting the juveniles (now returning as adults) is even lower.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2279,The first-time migrants hung out at their tropical wintering sites for almost a week more than adults!,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2280,One idea was that maybe they are in rough shape after duking it out for food with adult birds the whole winter.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

2290,"It could be that they are less efficient at flying (they do have shorter wings) or that they have less experience selecting tail winds, so each flight doesn’t take them as far as adults.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2291,One idea is that juvenile birds might actually be programmed to arrive later.,0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2292,"There are big costs to arriving at a breeding site first: it could get cold, food could be limiting, and early birds will likely have to fend off more than one rival for that prime territory.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2293,"In contrast, birds that wait a bit arrive when all the adults have settled on the best territories, and there may be comparatively little fuss when they arrive and set up shop in a lesser territory nearby.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/
2294,"The benefits might be that the weather is better and therefore food is probably more predictable, and a later arriving bird might not face as many risky territorial challenges.",0,https://birdbiologist.wordpress.com/category/research/

4368,In Greenland we find 235 different species of birds.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4369,"Some of the most common species are the sea eagles, Arctic fulmars, black guillemots, eiders, ptarmigans and of course the Arctic terns.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4370,Meet the Arctic Tern in Its Natural Habitat: Kitsissunnguit,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4371,"The Arctic tern lives near the ocean or at the brim of lakes, and is found in great numbers in the archipelago Kitsissunnguit.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4372,"Kitsissunnguit is located in Disko Bay, only a 1-2 hour boat ride away from the city Aasiaat.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4373,The islands of Kitsissunnguit have been preserved since 1988 due to the extensive birdlife and the many breeding Arctic terns.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4374,"Birdwatchers still have access to the islands, giving bird lovers a unique view of the Arctic terns’ life in their natural environment.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4375,Be Able to Identify the Arctic Tern,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4376,"The Arctic tern is a relatively little bird, and it looks quite elegant with its white feathers and black forehead.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4377,It is approximately 33-39 cm in length and has a wingspan of 66-77 cm.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4378,The Arctic tern can become as old as 30 years and they live together in colonies when breeding.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4379,"They mostly feed on small fish, such as capelins, fry and small crustaceans that live in the surface of the nearby ocean and lakes.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4380,"There isn’t much difference between the sexes, except for the males’ slightly longer tail feathers.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4381,"The trail was easy in the beginning, but it got significantly steeper and taxing as we got near the peak.",0,https://www.khairul-syahir.com/topics/friends/2010/mt-brinchang-cameron-highlands-hike.html
4382,When the terns are born they have a greyish or brownish down which is replaced with the white feathers with brown markings later on.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4383,"The Arctic terns start breeding at the age of two, arriving at Kitsissunnguit and places like it, in May and June before they go south for the winter.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4384,"They’ll then lay and nurture their eggs, and 21 days later the eggs will hatch and the youngs are born.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4385,The youngs stay in the nest for the next couple of days before they start exploring their nearby surroundings.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4386,After another 21 days the youngs start flying,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4387,The Arctic tern is a rather social bird that prefers to live together with a lot of other terns in big colonies.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4388,"The colonies usually consist of 10,000-20,000 tern couples, and it is estimated that Greenland is visited by 65,000 mating couples in every heavy mating year.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4389,With so many birds crammed together at a relatively small space gives the tern a great advantage relative to protecting themselves against predators.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4390,"Most birds are threatened by dangers such as humans, foxes, gulls and falcons, but the terns are known for their ability to scare these off.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4391,"It is so safe near the Arctic tern colonies, that other types of birds live right next to them for protection.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/

4393,"The Common Loon (Gavia immer) is a bird belonging to the loon (diver) family that is widespread across the northern United States, Canada, Greenland and Alaska.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4394,There are even some smaller populations living in Iceland.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4395,"Also known as the Great Northern Diver, the bird has a reclusive nature and tends to favour secluded lakes or estuaries.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4396,Common Loons are very territorial birds and you will usually find that only one family lives at any given body of water.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4397,"Common Loons are exceptional swimmers, but they are somewhat awkward on land.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4398,"Thus they nest as close to water as possible, eliminating the need to walk where possible.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4399,Nests are built in hollowed-out mounds of dirt and the female may lay 1-3 eggs in it.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4400,"Both parents work together to built the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the hatchlings.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4401,"Despite its name, the Common Loon is quite striking in appearance.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4402,It has Red-eyes and distinctive black and white stripe-like and spotty markings on its neck and wings.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/

4405,The Common Loon’s dagger-like beak is perfectly adapted for underwater diving and it can dive to depths of 90 ft.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4406,The adult Common Loon is 73-88 cm in length and has a 122-148 cm wingspan.,0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4407,"Though graceful in flight, their take-off and landings are somewhat clumsy.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4408,"During the winter months, the Common Loon is fairly quiet but during summer it becomes a noisy bird with quite an impressive range of sounds which many describe as ‘haunting wailing’,",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4409,"When combined, these sounds are known as a ‘tremolo’ call and they can be quite overwhelming.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4410,"The Common Loon lives mainly on fish, such as pike, perch, sunfish, trout and bass, which it catches underwater in lakes.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4411,"When near the sea, the bird tends to live on rock cod, flounders, herring and sea trout.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4412,"Unfortunately, large numbers of these birds disappeared from lakes in eastern North America because of acid rain and pollution.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
4413,"Their numbers also dwindled because of lead poisoning, industrial waste contamination and decreasing water levels.",0,http://www.birds.com/blog/tag/greenland/
